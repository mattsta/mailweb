# DEBUGGING
# You can debug fail2ban behavior by running it in the foreground with
# client debug and server debug logging:
# fail2ban-client -vvvvvvvvvv --loglevel DEBUG -f -x start
# In another terminal:
# tail -F /var/log/fail2ban.log
#
# It helps to delete the persistent save db before fail2ban is started
# in debug mode too:
# rm /var/lib/fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3


# And we're always watching
# If you're testing/debugging your auth and failing your own logins
# either by mistake or intentionally, you'll want to either decrease
# the findtime, decrease the bantime, increase the maxretry time,
# or just disable fail2ban for [findtime] after your testing.
